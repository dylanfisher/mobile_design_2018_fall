1. Helpful App: Based on the critique from today&rsquo;s class, select one concept to expand on...
* Figure out what pages you'll need for your project. Create a site map or userflow that shows this.
* Create a PDF/InVision/Google Slides/Presentation that we can easily pull up in class that introduces 3 different visual directions for this one concept.
* For each visual direction, introduce the concept with language, images, and research. Try to create a clear and concise idea using references that support your thought process. Things you might highlight: typography, image style: photography, illustrations, none, tone of voice, type of user.
* Design 3 pages of your app in the style of each visual direction.
