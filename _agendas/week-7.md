### In Class

- Save your work on [the drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i0rENBborFjuzRbNJPfA7cc6s-mDJKo9) in a folder with your name
- Students get in pairs. Your partner is your discussion leader.
- Present work from last week. Your partner will lead the critique. Example questions:
  * Which is the most succesful direction? Why?
  * Which is the clearest direction?
  * In one word, how would you describe each direction?
  * What direction has the most potential to produce unexpected results?
  * How would you push your favorite direction forward? What could help refine this idea?
  * Which of the directions feels different from what exists?
  * Which of the designs is most believable at the moment? Least believable?
  * Does the design match the integrity of the concept?



### Homework

1. Helpful App: Based on the critique from today&rsquo;s class, pick one direction and begin developing it.
  * Create wireframes for the main pages
  * Begin designing off of the wireframes.
  * Come to class next week with the main pages fleshed out. We will have individual meetings and a work period.
