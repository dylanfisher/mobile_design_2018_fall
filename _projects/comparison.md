### Introduction

1. Find 3 examples of websites that change from desktop to mobile (can be a separate app or just a website). Try to find ones that have a seamless experience on both, however, if you find bad examples, those are fair game, also. (limit to 1 bad example).
2. Here are some things to observe: layout changes, type changes, hierarchy changes, use of location, hidden fields.
3. Document your findings in a google slides presentation with screenshots and links to the websites.
4. Title your slide document as “Firstname-Lastname_Comparison”
5. Save your slides file to the shared google drive with today’s date.
