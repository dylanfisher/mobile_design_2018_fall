### Introduction

1. Create a mobile application that’s meant to assist you in some way. Perhaps it’s a tool to help you remember your groceries, or maybe it’s an app that helps you remember your friend’s birthdays, or maybe it’s an app that reminds you to go to bed at the same time everyday. Consider what would be helpful to an audience larger than just yourself.
2. Create wireframes and a user flow for all the pages you’ll need.
3. Once you’ve decided on your idea, investigate what the app should look like. Research examples of similar apps (they don’t have to have the same purpose, but perhaps they have a similar user flow). Create an overview of what your design inspiration is. Do you need photography for your app? What about illustrations? Create an art direction list of all the assets you’ll need to communicate your vision. Create three different iterations of a few main pages.
4. Decide on your execution and finalize the design. Create a functioning prototype for it.
5. Create a short, branded PDF that explains your project in a memorable, concise, and visual way. Imagine that this is the deck you would show to an investor who wants to help you make your project a reality.
