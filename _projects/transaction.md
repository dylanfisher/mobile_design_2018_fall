### Introduction

1. Choose a multi-step transaction you encounter online. Your service should have several different pages and input fields (so, no mailing list sign ups). Here are some good examples: Purchasing airline tickets, Signing up for a recurring service, Signing up for a medical website (such as zocdoc)
2. Create a site map of all the pages you’ll need for your transaction.
3. Create wireframes for all the pages you’ll need to design. Wireframes should feel organized, but design is not the focus. Create a type system with scale and limit yourself to 1-2 legible typefaces. Be sure to catch all the screens – for example, what happens when someone enters an invalid address?
4. Refine your wireframes with a light pass at design. The design shouldn’t feel like the finished product, but should feel consistent and easy to use. For examples – consider incorporating a meaningful color pallet (active links and titles are all the same color, links are treated the same way on all pages, all image placeholders are treated the same way). Create a functional prototype that takes you from screen to screen
