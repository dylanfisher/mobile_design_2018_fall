### Introduction

1. Find a text to typeset. The text should be written by an outside source, and be published online, either by the author or a third party at some point in time. Be prepared to explain why you chose the text.
2. Using what you know so far about responsive web design, create a page that captures the spirit of the text. Have fun and have justifications for why you chose to design it in such a way and for what you choose to add to the text, if anything. (I.e Photographs, illustrations etc.)
3. Design your homepage at 3 screen sizes: wide screen (1440 x 900), laptop (1200 x 800), and mobile (375 px wide) (With the exception of mobile, these dimensions are example screen sizes your browser might be on these devices and not the size of the actual device)
